This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysisfor the specified tool in your repository.Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`in the 200 response is `null`.As an example of the deletion process,let&apos;s imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning toolto analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.You&apos;ve now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.To start, you must find an analysis that&apos;s identified as deletable.Each set of analyses always has one that&apos;s identified as deletable.Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they&apos;re all deleted.Then repeat the process for the second set.The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:**Outer loop**:* List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.* Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:  **Inner loop**:  * Delete the identified analysis.  * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool&apos;s analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool&apos;s analysis entirely.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with private or public repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with only public repositories.
